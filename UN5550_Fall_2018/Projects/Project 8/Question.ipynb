I was catching up on my sports news, http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/25385890/no-1-ohio-state-ncaa-initial-net-basketball-ratings-raise-questions, and thought to myself, I wonder how i would interpret the framework behind the \"NET\" rankings in terms of a network, and if my resulting data visualization would portray the findings of that ranking in a consistent fashion.    This is an open-ended question with no specific right or wrong answer; it is merely designed to have you think about how you might migrate from thinking about tabular data to thinking about networks.  \n",
    "    - If you were to get your hands on the data used behind NET (e.g., team, game scores, conference, etc... ), describe one way in which you could interpret the data as a network.\n",
    "    - What might a centrality measure indicate based on your network?"
